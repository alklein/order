In this chapter I discuss the some of the details of the 
specification details of the Caledon language.  

The section on the pipeline introduces the order that programs are typechecked and run. 
The section on inference discusses the benefits of typechecking in a lazy environment.
The section on families introduces the notion of a coherent set of axioms for proof search, 
falling under the same searchable family.
The section on controlled nondeterminism extends the notion of a searchable 
family and introduces the technique of nondeterminism control. 
The last section on IO describes some techniques of defining, controlling, and implementing IO.
