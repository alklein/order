Universe checking would be an ideal way to ensure separation of phases and allow compilation. 
Modal provability logics might also be used for this purpose.  
In general, running of these programs in the current implementation is excruciatingly slow, 
as types need to be recorded and searched during runtime.  
Algorithms that take advantage of totality checking \citep{altenkirch2010termination}, 
uniqueness checking \citep{anderson2004verifying}, 
worlds checking\citep{anderson2004verifying}, 
mode checking\citep{anderson2004verifying}, 
and universe checking \citep{harper1991type}, 
could be implemented and applied as they were for twelf and agda.
