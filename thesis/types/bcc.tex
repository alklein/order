\section{Bicolored Calculus of Constructions}

The Bicolored Calculus of Constructions \citep{luther2001more}
can be considered 
\begin{figure}[h]
\[ 
E ::= V 
 \orr S 
 \orr E\;E 
 \orr E\;[E]
 \orr \lambda V . E 
 \orr \Pi V : E . E 
 \orr \forall V : E . E 
\]

\end{figure}

The usefullness of $CC^{Bi}$ comes from the fact that the
consistency of the $CC^{Bi}$ is a direct result of the consistency of CC.
Because of this, one can use $CC^{Bi}$ as a target language for the result of implicit argument 
generation of a system with omitted implicit types, and obtain consistency of 
the underlying monochromatic $\lambda$ calculus from the conversion,
given that reductions are not typed in this calculus.
