In this paper we present the typing rules and elaboration semantics for a higher order dependently typed logic programming language, Caledon, 
    with a Turing complete type inference and implicit argument system.  
We note that the dynamic semantics of a higher order logic programming language are the same as those used to perform type inference in a
    dependently typed language.
Because dependently typed languages use code in their types by definition, we create a language where the same 
    execution semantics based on unification and proof search are used for both type and term inference.  
To take advantage of this feature,
    we supplement the language with inference control constructs not available in the usual implicit calculus of constructions.
As a consequence of these extensions,
    the elaborated unification problems are unique in that they generate terms as well as types.
Furthermore, because every result of execution is a term in the consistent calculus of constructions, Caledon can be considered 
    an interactive theorem prover with a less orthogonal combination of proof search and proof checking than has previously been implemented.
