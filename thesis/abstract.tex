In this thesis I present a logic programming language, caledon, with a pure type system
and a turing complete type inference and implicit argument system based on the semantics of the
object language.  Because the language has dependent types and type inference, terms can be generated 
by providing type constraints.  The addition of control structures such as implicits, costructor hiding,
shared holes, existential quantification, polymorphism, and nondeterminism make the language ideal for 
creating libraries for defining EDSLs.  Furthermore, the system can be made consistent and sound with 
the addition of totality, worlds, and universe checks. Proof irrelivance, universes, and uniqueness 
checking can be used to constrain the nondeterminism of type inference in a pure type system, and help 
programmers control coherence.
