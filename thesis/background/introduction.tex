``To be fair, even in last century's typed languages, 
types had a beneficial organisational effect on programmers. 
This century, it's just possible types will have a comparable effect on programs. 
Types are concepts and now mechanisms supporting program-discovery as well as error-discovery. 
I think that's more than just gravy.''
